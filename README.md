# fizzbuzz

The fizzbuzz project was part of a weekly challenge at Makers Academy. We solved fizzbuzz by pairing and using RSpec for TDD. 

"Ping pong" and "change the essage" was used as a pairing style. And we solved fizzbuzz in 2 different ways. 

This repository contains the files from our second attempt where we used a more direct approach in our test examples and a better code for our program.
